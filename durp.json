Have people struggled to find a way to do the impossible? Is time a physical thing? Or is hope just clouding the minds of people, making them believe they can do what they cant? Time could just be what people perceive it to be. Maybe time is just the reactions of matter and activity between things, but then there's no way of reversing it is there? That would mean that whatever experiences time travel backwards would not disappear and reappear in the past, it would just mean that their actions would reverse. If that is true, then whatever is not affected by time travel would change while something tries reversing its actions. Then, the actions would have to change because everything else is staying normal. Would you have to then change everything but yourself to travel through time? But then again, let's say you walk towards a shadow. When you are on the shadow, you will travel backwards through time. Because your goal is to cross it, that means you would teleport to the end of the shadow, walk backwards to the beginning of the shadow, then end up at the end of the shadow and you would be normal again. Even so, there are a lot of flaws with that. What if you teleport outside of the shadow to where you want to end? does that mean that because you are now out of the shadow, you teleported to a part of your possible future? How do you even teleport? If that is not true, would you then walk backwards when you first touch the shadow? If so, wouldn\'t you then be out of the shadow? Would you perceive that as walking in to the shadow and suddenly being out of it, or would that mean because you are out of the shadow the shadow is an uncrossable object? What happens if you walk backwards once you touch the shadow? does that mean you walk forwards through the shadow? Or do you teleport outside of the shadow or inside or find away to still be stuck when that happens? Think about it!",
